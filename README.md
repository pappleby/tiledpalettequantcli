# tiledpalettequantcli

A nodejs cli version of https://github.com/rilden/tiledpalettequant (https://rilden.github.io/tiledpalettequant/) allowing for conversion of images to quantized bitmap files, with optional dithering. 

An additional feature is the ability to vertically split the quantized image. This can be used to quantize multiple images using a shared set of palletes.
